# Blubito's Advent of Frontend 🎅🏻 🎄


Here you can find all challenges and their respective examples for the Advent of Frontend. Each challenge will be in a folder named with a prefix for the date of the challenge and either `challenge` or `example`. E.g. `01-challenge`/`01-example`, `21-challenge`, etc.


## What?

Since we can see cars stuck in the “unexpected” snow and hear more and more Mariah Carey literally everywhere we're adding to the “holiday” spirit by proposing our own Advent of Frontend.

Advent of Frontend is just our cheesy rip off of **Advent of Code** - annual programming challenge that takes place during the Advent season, typically starting on December 1st and lasting until December 25th. It provides a series of programming puzzles, one for each day leading up to Christmas. The puzzles are designed to be fun and challenging, covering a variety of algorithmic and computational problems.
 
As this is “Fronted” you will get different challenges specifically for frontend topics like styling, creating elements, layouts, etc. Each task will have an example uploaded later on its release date, probably written in React. You are free to choose any tech stack (Vanilla/React/Angular/Vue/Svelte/Rust/etc), but keep in mind that the example maybe won’t match your desired choice. But in the end of the day everything is JS, so you should be able to grasp the implementation concept non the less  The challenges are aimed to be relatively small and specific, so don't expect any over the top projects.
 
The event will start from 1st of December and end on the 22nd - this is because we will release the challenges only from Monday to Friday. This means that we’ll have a more “slim version” of only 16 challenges
