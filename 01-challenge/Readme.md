# Theme swticher

**Day 01 - 01.12.2023**


## Description ðŸŽ„

As your first task, you will need to take an existing simple website and transform it to add "theme-swtich". Depending on the selected theme, the colors of the website should change. You need to add a functional element to change the selected theme (button/switch/link/etc.), think how you will handle the switching of the colors inside your styles and adjust the design.

Under `/resourcess` you will find your prepared html and css files. Use these as your sceleton - you can add and change anything in the page.

The current color pallete is based on this one here - https://coolors.co/230903-44633f-9ebc9f-d3b88c-f4f2f3 . Your task is to not only add functional-wise a theme switcher, but also to adjust the overall theme. The new colors are "Christmas" themed and available here - https://coolors.co/palette/da2c38-226f54-87c38f-f4f0bb-43291f . You need to be creative and decide yourself how and what you will change regarding the colors. Feel free to choose any other theme, but try to keep it "festiv" ðŸŽ….
