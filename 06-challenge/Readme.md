You can use the following Figma-Design for reference: https://www.figma.com/file/igvu87mzyaStNlsi5B0jZy/Christmas-online-shop-(Community)?type=design&node-id=0-7&mode=design&t=Ow7OlqxTks139gwC-0

If you feel extra creative today go for it and recreate the complete design, but no preasure :D

## Hints:
- to configure Tailwind refer to: https://tailwindcss.com/docs/configuration. You can setup the needed colors for the design, font-families etc.
- You can find a base tailwind.config.js in `resources`
- you can export any needed asset from the design. However, a lot of them are provided to you under `resources/assets`.

### Fonts: 
  - font-family: 'Mountains of Christmas', serif;
  - font-family: 'Fredoka', sans-serif;
